                <h1>BEFORE</h1>
                <p>Before starting my service with AmeriCorps VISTA Program, 
                   I was a recent graduate with the CNM Ingenuity in Albuquerque, NM.
                   I attended the JAVA/ Android Bootcamp and successfully received my 
                   certificate in August of 2019. What my previous plan entailed was to
                   gain experience by being employed as an intern so that I can gain
                   real-world hands-on experience. At the same time, I wanted to keep 
                   going with my schooling.  </p>

                <h1>PRESENT</h1>
                <p>Presently I am working with the AmericaCorp VISTA Program and while 
                    gaining some experience I also am volunteering with a great program, 
                    STEAM New Mexico. With STEAM I can help with fighting poverty through 
                    using science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. 
                    I can volunteer my time and efforts while gaining some real-world 
                    experience. I am glad that I found a position where my time is 
                    appreciated and my worksite has gone above and beyond in molding my 
                    position into what it is now.</p>

                <h1>FUTURE</h1>
                <p>Looking into the future I cannot see clearly what it holds but what I 
                    want to accomplish is easier said that done. Right now, my future goal 
                    is to finish off school at Central New Mexico Community College (CNM) 
                    with an A.A.S in Computer Information Systems – Computer Programming. 
                    Also try to pass my JAVA Certification sometimes before February 2020. 
                    After CNM I would like to transfer to a University and receive my 
                    bachelor’s in Computer Science. While working on that I also would 
                    like to get into Computer Networking side of things and try to get 
                    my certificates such as CISCO, CompTIA, Microsoft MCS, etc. One day my 
                    career goal is to Network Architect/Engineer and be an app developer.</p>
